# Coursera_Project1
Getting and Cleaning Data / Final project
This project is using a dataset related to Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (UCI HAR Dataset)

The dataset must be accessible from the computer you run the R script
At the beginning of the script provided (i.e. run_analysis.R) a variable Path_file must be initilized with the location of the UCI HAR Dataset.

In a Windows environment, that should look like:
Path_file = "C:\\Coursera\\Final project\\UCI HAR Dataset\\"

This variable is used by the script to read the different files.

In this directory, you will find:
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
- The script run_analysis.R

The initial dataset is available here:

Thanks for reviewing this project
