Getting and Cleaning Data / Final project

This project is using a dataset related to Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (UCI HAR Dataset)

The dataset must be accessible from the computer you run the R script
At the beginning of the script provided (i.e. run_analysis.R), a variable Path_file must be initilized with the location of the UCI HAR Dataset.

In a Windows environment, that should look like:
Path_file = "C:\\Coursera\\Final project\\UCI HAR Dataset\\"

This variable is used by the script to read the different files.

In this directory, you will find:
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
- The script run_analysis.R

The initial dataset is available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The objectives of the project are:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, 
- creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Final result is available in Syn_Results.txt

Thanks for reviewing this project
